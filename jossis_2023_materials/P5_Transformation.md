### Example 2

text = """
Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking \
mine from my room.  Yes, adults also like pandas too.  She takes \
it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute.  One of the \
ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was \
designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it \
though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for \
the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got \
to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.
"""
