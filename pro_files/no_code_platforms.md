# Designing AI ChatBots using no-code platforms

In hands-on sessions related to designing and implementing AI ChatBots using Langchain and OpenAI API, we show one approach to that process. Specifically, we can use other APIs, such as Hugging Face, Anthropic, Google, Meta LLaMA, Mistral, etc.  In essence, that approach and similar approaches (e.g., RASA) share one characteristic: some knowledge of Python programming. These days, no-code platforms offer an alternative to coding practices for AI ChatBots and AI assistant development and implementation. There are many options among such platforms as:

1. [VoiceFlow](https://www.voiceflow.com/)
2. [Botpress](https://botpress.com/)
3. [ChatBot](https://www.chatbot.com/)

There are differences among the platforms mentioned, but our focus is different. In hands-on sessions, we will work only with VoiceFlow, an alternative approach for realizing the final project related to the listed [Final project requirements](./final_project.md).
