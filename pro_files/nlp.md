# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

> Why do we need NLP in AI ChatBots?

The heart of an AI chatbot is its ability to understand and process user inputs, typically in natural language (e.g., English, German, Croatian, etc.). Besides that, Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
have tools for chatbots to interpret, analyze, and generate human language, allowing them to interact with users effectively in a conversational manner.

> Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with different tasks performed by computers based on content derived from human language.

# Computer tasks in NLP

1. Question Answering (Jeopardy - won by IBM's Watson in 2011.)
2. Information extraction:

The original dataset is from Kaggle [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download&select=IMDB+Dataset.csv) and we will use it on `hands-on` afternoon session. 

In this NLP task, we usually have a human-generated opinion in text format, which can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Other types of sentiment analysis can encompass a wide range of nuances related to sentiment, but in most cases, the three-class analysis is the most common.
