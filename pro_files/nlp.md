# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

> Why do we need NLP in AI ChatBots?

The hart of an AI chatbot is its ability to understand and process user inputs, which are typically in the form of natural language (e.g., English, German, Croatian, etc.). Besides that, Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
have tools for chatbots to interpret, analyze, and generate human language, allowing them to effectively interact with users in a conversational manner.

> Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with different tasks performed by computers based on content derived from human language.
