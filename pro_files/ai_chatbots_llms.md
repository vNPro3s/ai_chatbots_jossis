# AI ChatBots and LLMs

There are many definitions, but we will start with the following:

"An AI chatbot is an intelligent system composed of natural language processing components, machine learning, and knowledge base integration that enables dynamic, context-aware, and human-like conversations. It can understand, process, and generate human language, adapt to different interaction scenarios, and perform specific tasks such as answering queries, providing recommendations, or automating services."

In this course, we focus specifically on text-to-text AI ChatBots while recognizing the multimodal capabilities of contemporary ChatBots, such as those that can handle text, voice, and images.

The field of ChatBots dates back to the 1960s, and since then, huge advancements have been detected, especially in the last decade. Figure 1 depicts a timeline with major contributions in that field.
