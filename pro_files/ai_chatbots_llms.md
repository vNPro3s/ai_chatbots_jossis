# AI ChatBots and LLMs

There are many definitions, but we will start with the following:

"An AI chatbot is an intelligent system composed of natural language processing components, machine learning, and knowledge base integration that enables dynamic, context-aware, and human-like conversations. It can understand, process, and generate human language, adapt to different interaction scenarios, and perform specific tasks such as answering queries, providing recommendations, or automating services."

In this course, we focus specifically on text-to-text AI ChatBots while recognizing the multimodal capabilities of contemporary ChatBots, such as those that can handle text, voice, and images.

The field of ChatBots dates back to the 1960s, and since then, huge advancements have been detected, especially in the last decade. Figure 1 depicts a timeline with some notable contributions in that field.

The first chatbots were restricted to performing only a limited pre-programmed response. So-called `rule-based chatbots` follow predefined rules in answering prepared questions, similar to the FAQs section. They are designed to respond to those questions, provide limited information, or guide users through specific tasks. Their minimal capabilities do not offer any flexibility, which often leads to blind street scenarios, frequently producing user dissatisfaction. 

On the other hand, AI Chatbots, or sometimes Conversational AI-driven Chatbots, refer to sophisticated technological solutions that enable computers (machines in general) to converse with humans or other machines using natural language. Advancements in various fields, such as NLP, ML, DL, database, and dialog management, led to the rapid development of AI chatbots that solved most of the shortcomings of rule-based chatbots and offered higher flexibility. The core features of conversational AI ChatBots are[^1]:

  - Understanding of Context: NLU systems comprehend the broader context of a conversation, processing words about the surrounding text or dialogue. 

  - Semantic Understanding: These systems grasp the meaning of words, including synonyms, slang, dialects, and jargon, often through entity recognition, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of user input.

  - Handling of Ambiguity: NLU systems can interpret vague or ambiguous expressions using contextual clues, inferring the most likely meaning based on the previous conversation.

  - Intent Recognition: NLU identifies the underlying intent of a user’s words, understanding what the user wants to accomplish, not just the literal meaning of the input.

  - Entity Recognition: The system identifies and categorizes specific named entities (like persons, locations, dates) within the text, enabling more precise interpretation.

  - Slot Filling: Extracts relevant information from user input (based on entity recognition) and places it into predefined slots for later use, such as booking a hotel or making an appointment.

  - Sentiment Analysis: NLU systems assess the emotional tone of a user’s input, determining whether they are happy, frustrated, or upset and adjusting the response accordingly.

  - Conversation Management: NLU systems track the history and flow of a conversation, managing interruptions, topic changes, and follow-up questions to create smoother, human-like interactions.

  - Multilingual Capability: Advanced NLU systems can understand and respond in multiple languages, enabling global communication and customer service.

  - Integration with External Systems: NLU systems can connect to external databases, CRMs, or APIs, allowing real-time data retrieval for more personalized and relevant responses.

AI Chatbots are used in a wide range of domains, including customer service, language translation, education, healthcare, banking and insurance, retail, and human resources.
