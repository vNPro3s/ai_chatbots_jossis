# Prompt Design

From the topic related to LangChain and AI Chatbots, we observed that the prompt plays a crucial role in the quality of AI chatbots. Also, in this part of the hands-on, we demonstrated the so-called `hallucination` problem of the LLMs with minor changes in prompt template design. To conclude, prompt design is crafting prompts that produce desired, high-quality, reliable LLMs or AI Chatbot results.  

There are some recipes for efficient, prompt design. Contemporary LLMs are trained on reliable and accessible data from the entire Internet. That means their knowledge is broad (but again restricted), and to get a desired answer, one needs to pose well-coined questions (prompts). Here, the known proverb is true:

> It is better to pose a good question than give an excellent answer to a wrong one.

When designing a good prompt, have in mind the following:

 - at this stage, the reasoning of LLMs is different than the reasoning of humans (what is evident for humans is not for LLMs)
 - the vagueness of natural language can produce misunderstanding
 - knowledge base of some topics shares the same or similar terminology

To avoid undesired results, ensure that model guessing is kept to a minimum.
