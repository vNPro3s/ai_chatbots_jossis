# Prompt Design

From the topic related to LangChain and AI Chatbots, we observed that the prompt plays a crucial role in the quality of AI chatbots. Also, in this part of the hands-on, we demonstrated the so-called `hallucination` problem of the LLMs with minor changes in prompt template design. To conclude, prompt design is the process of crafting prompts that produce desired, high-quality, reliable LLMs or AI Chatbot results.
